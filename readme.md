# References
- Simple Flask app by [Python Simplified](youtube.com/watch?v=6plVs_ytIH8)

# My features on this tut
- Used [Static assets storing](https://www.codegrepper.com/code-examples/python/flask+static+images) instead of url access
- Changed default route to "/"
- My own css styling, this is normal tho :D 

# How to run
- Make sure that your computer has Python in it
- `git clone` this repo
- Use `python -m venv env` to create virtual env for Flask app
- Activate that venv
- Use `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `flask run` then start your development from this point
